Changes made to Bio by Stephen Haines, Oct 2018
-----------------------------------------------

Documentation improved/corrected
- references to nucleotides/RNA/DNA removed from protein alphabets.
- <inheritdoc/> tag added in places.

New base class (BasicProteinAlphabet) added for the Protein alpabet
- this excludes Gap and Termination symbols.

Interfaces for alphabets added
- ultimately these all inherit from IAlphabet.

IsDna, IsProtein and IsRna properties added to alphabets
- to facilitate testing the type of molecule the alphabet represents.

GetInvalidSymbols(ISequence sequence) method added to protein alphabets.

basicSymbols set removed from ProteinAlphabet
- replaced by ambiguousSymbols set in AmbiguousProteinAlphabet.

Names of Asp and Glu changed from 'Aspartic' to 'Aspartic Acid', and 'Glutamic' to 'Glutamic Acid'. 

Some refactoring performed using ReSharper
- redundant qualifiers removed.
- var used instead of explicit type declarations.
- collection initialisers used instead of Add method.
- nameof() used instead of literal strings.

NotSupportedException() thrown by GetAmbiguousSymbols() in protein alphabets
