Changes made to Bio by Stephen Haines, Oct 2018
-----------------------------------------------

Documentation improved/corrected
- references to nucleotides/RNA/DNA removed from protein alphabets.
- <inheritdoc/> tag added in places.

New base class (StrictProteinAlphabet) added for the Protein alpabet
- this excludes Gap and Termination symbols.
- methods moved to this from ProteinAlphabet.

New base class (ProteinFragment) for peptides identified by MS (i.e. from known proteins)
- added virtual ValidateSequence() method that chaecks location of peptide-specific symbols.

Interfaces for alphabets added
- ultimately these all inherit from IAlphabet.

IsDna, IsProtein and IsRna properties added to alphabets
- to facilitate testing the type of molecule the alphabet represents.

GetInvalidSymbols(ISequence sequence) method added to protein alphabets.

basicSymbols set removed from ProteinAlphabet
- replaced by ambiguousSymbols set in AmbiguousProteinAlphabet.

Names of Asp and Glu changed from 'Aspartic' to 'Aspartic Acid', and 'Glutamic' to 'Glutamic Acid'. 

Spelling of Threonine corrected from 'Threoine'

Some refactoring performed using ReSharper
- redundant qualifiers removed.
- collection initialisers used instead of Add method.
- nameof() used instead of literal strings.

NotSupportedException() thrown by GetAmbiguousSymbols() in protein alphabets 

Added AutoDetectProteinAlphabet() method to Alphabets class.

ValidateSequence() made virtual in Strict

Test data changed to allow for new alphabets
- invalid sequence data on 2nd line of FastQFileWithInvalidAlphabet.fastq changed from '123' to '$%^'.

Added ValidateSequence(byte[] symbols) overload to protein alphabets.
